what is microservice and monolith?
- Earlier we used to work only one project so all the dev working on Like 
is a java app. so this is only one repo for this app so this is called monolith..
If I want to change only one button so all apps need to be updated again so here micorservice
comes in to picture Instead of having just one project we now have small-small component with differnt functionality. like api handled
with js my notification handled with python and each project might be different port so they call each other from differnet url.


why do we need use state?
-  useState is hook and hooks  is just a norrmal function. useEffect has two parameten one is call back function and other is
dependency []. suppose if i called api in fetch so every state change or props changes api will call again and again this is not good so we can use useState in this
scenrio.IF i put [] empty dependency so it will call only once. we can use useState fo side effect.

what is optional chaning?
- optional chaining is a feature of javascript that allows you to access the properties of an object or array without having to
check whether the object or array is null or undefined first. it is represented by(?.) can be used to concisely deeply nested
properties without having to write a long chain of if statement for check for null or undefined values.
