What is Reconciliation?
- Reconciliation has a Diffing algorithm which find out the difference b/w the tree(dom or virtual dom).
when It find out the difference. It will re-render only the portion which is required.

why do we need keys?
- suppose if we have a 4 div(1,2,3,4) after that we added one div(5,1,2,3,4).
 so react doesn't know what order they were actually present.So It will re-render everything(5,1,2,3,4,).
 if we use key which is unique so React will get to know number 5 div came up later So it will re-render only 5 which is required.

{TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX.
A: The Difference is stated below:

{TitleComponent}: This value describes the TitleComponent as a javascript expression or a variable. The {} can embed a javascript expression or a variable inside it.
<TitleComponent/> : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. In simple terms TitleComponent a function that is returning a JSX value. A component is written inside the {<  />} expression.
<TitleComponent></TitleComponent> : <TitleComponent /> and <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> are equivalent only when < TitleComponent /> has no child components. The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.


U can add this css
.card h4{
   text-overflow: ellipsis; /* enables ellipsis /
   white-space: nowrap; / keeps the text in a single line /
   overflow: hidden; / keeps the element from overflowing its parent */
}
