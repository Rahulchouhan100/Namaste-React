when and why do we need lazy() loading?

--if we're building large web apps so we need chunking because
if I wrap all the code in to index.js file so it will take so
much time to load and it makes our apps heavy so that's why 
we need lazy loading things. so we can separate other component in to
another file.


What is suspense?
-- When you're loading component in demand react tries to suspend it.
Suspense takes care everything it will until the promise resolved.

Advantages and disadvantages of using this code spillitng
pattern?

- so much advantages like if you're building large apps like
MMT so user comes in to website with intent like flight bookin. It might
possible to user will visit in to cab or buses section so Instead of render every
-thing we will do on demand loading.

When do we and why do we need suspense?
-- when we're creating lazy loading. we need suspense because at the initial
render index.js file will load right? so in this index.js file has not instamart.js
file so first time it will give error so that's we need suspense.
